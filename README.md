# javaScriptApps
Free to All, learn javaScript using the simple Applications I made. 
The Code is easy to understand and contains a mixture of HTML, css, javascript written in seperate files. The applications can be run in the browser by running the index.html files. Make sure that you have downloaded the folders in your computer/device before running. Feel free to update the files as they were made with the intention of learning. They might look vague but will do wonders for you all to understand javascript and provide some level of bolier plate to you coders.

Happy coding :)
